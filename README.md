# Collada to JSON converter

The tool runs in a browser and converts Colladas to Threejs' own JSON format. The resulting JSON file will be downloaded to your hard disk. Textures are supported.

There are 2 versions

 - preview version: shows a preview of the model both as Collada and as JSON (see this [repository](https://github.com/tweedegolf/collada2json))
 - headless version that just converts the Collada

The first version is suitable if you want to convert only one or a few models and check the models side by side for possible conversion errors. If you want to convert a large number of Colladas youâ€™d better use the second version.

You can checkout the code and run the tool on your local computer, or you can use the headless version directly:

 - [preview version](https://tweedegolf.github.io/collada2json)
 - [headless version](https://tweedegolf.github.io/collada2json_headless)


To run the code on your local computer:

 - npm install
 - npm run watch

The last command starts a local webserver at http://localhost:8000.

All npm scripts:

 - npm start &rarr; starts a local webserver at http://localhost:8000
 - npm run watch &rarr; compiles es2015 code to javascript as soon as you have changed code
 - npm run build &rarr; compiles and minifies the code and creates a source map
