# Collada to JSON converter

The tool runs in a browser and converts Colladas to Threejs' own JSON format. The resulting JSON file will be downloaded to your hard disk. Textures are supported.


There are 2 versions

 - preview version: shows a preview of the model both as Collada and as JSON (in the branch 'preview')
 - headless version that just converts the Collada (in the branch 'headless')

The first version is suitable if you want to convert only one or a few models and check the models side by side for possible conversion errors. If you want to convert a large number of Colladas youâ€™d better use the second version.


You can checkout the code and run the tool on your local computer, or you can use them directly from our server:

 - [preview version](http://data.tweedegolf.nl/collada2json/)
 - [headless version](http://data.tweedegolf.nl/collada2json_headless/)


To run the code on your local computer:

 - npm install
 - npm run watch

The last command starts a local webserver at http://localhost:8000.

All npm scripts:

 - npm start --> starts a local webserver at http://localhost:8000
 - npm run watch --> compiles es2015 code to javascript as soon as you have changed code
 - npm run build --> compiles and minifies the code and creates a source map
